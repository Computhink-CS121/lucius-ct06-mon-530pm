## Task 6: Age and Name Concatenation

#Assign a name to the variable "user_name"
#Assign an integer to the variable "user_age"
#Use type conversion and string concatenation to print out
#"{user_name} is {user_age} years old "
# year_born = input("what year are you born")
# year_born = int(year_born)
# current_year = 2025
# age = currect year = 2025
